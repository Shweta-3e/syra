We will write an application 
using c#. net , SignalR, EF

1) Web application - We job -
	This api will be called from Javascript - using signalR mechanism
	After receiving request from Client --> API will call Luis api and Based on intent/entities, prepare response for client
	Using signalR, send response to the respsctive client only
	On clinet side - when Server push message - Display that in chat bot window

	1 Santosh - Tax related bot with standard available response
	2 Partha - Tax related bot i need my response as per my requirement
	3 Shweta - Tax related bot with your standard response with few more additional responses
	4 Agamoni - Tax related bot with your standard response with some q&A to be not answered 
	
	HasAdditionalResponse = false 
	
	A - A
	B - B
//  C - C -- 20000
	
	10 = 20000*10 = custom
	
	
	1 A - A
	1 B - B 
	1 C - C
	
	Very first - all standard insert into mapped table for that customer 
	
	2 A - AB  -- ParentId
